    definition:
      "Price-to-Earnings Ratio is a valuation ratio of a company's current share price compared to its per-share earnings. It indicates how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings.",
    category: "fundamentals",
    extendedDefinition:
      "The P/E ratio is one of the most widely used valuation metrics in the stock market. It's calculated by dividing a company's current share price by its earnings per share (EPS). For example, if a company is trading at $50 per share and has an EPS of $5, its P/E ratio is 10. This means investors are willing to pay $10 for every $1 of earnings the company generates.",

      "Lower P/E ratios may indicate undervalued stocks, while higher ratios might suggest overvaluation or high growth expectations",
      "P/E ratios should be compared within the same industry, as different sectors have different typical P/E ranges",

    extendedDefinition:
      "Inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power per unit of money. Central banks attempt to limit inflationâ€”and avoid deflationâ€”in order to keep the economy running smoothly.",
    keyPoints: [
      "Inflation is typically measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or Producer Price Index (PPI)",
      "Moderate inflation (2-3%) is generally considered healthy for a growing economy",
      "High inflation can erode savings and fixed incomes",
      "Inflation affects different asset classes differently, with some serving as inflation hedges",
    ],
    examples: [
      "The United States experienced high inflation in the 1970s, reaching over 14% in 1980",
      "Zimbabwe experienced hyperinflation in the late 2000s, with inflation rates in the millions of percent",
      "Japan has struggled with very low inflation and even deflation since the 1990s",

      howToIdentify:
        "Inflation is typically visualized through line charts showing the percentage change in price indices over time. Rising lines indicate increasing inflation rates, while falling lines show disinflation.",
      steps: [
        "Monitor monthly CPI and PPI reports released by government statistical agencies",
        "Compare current inflation rates to historical averages and central bank targets",
        "Analyze inflation across different categories (food, energy, housing, etc.) to identify specific pressure points",
        "Consider core inflation (excluding volatile food and energy prices) for underlying trends",
        "Watch for changes in inflation expectations in consumer surveys and market-based measures",

    misconceptions: [
      {
        myth: "Inflation is always bad for the economy",
        reality:
          "Moderate inflation (around 2%) is actually considered beneficial as it encourages spending and investment rather than holding cash. Deflation (falling prices) can be more damaging as it can lead to decreased spending and economic contraction.",
      },
      {
        myth: "Printing money always causes high inflation",
        reality:
          "While excessive money creation can lead to inflation, the relationship is complex. Factors like velocity of money, output gaps, and global forces also play crucial roles. Japan has expanded its money supply significantly without generating high inflation.",
      },
      {
        myth: "Inflation affects all goods and services equally",
        reality:
          "Inflation rates vary widely across different sectors and goods. For example, technology often experiences deflation (falling prices) even during periods of overall inflation, while healthcare and education costs have typically risen faster than general inflation.",
